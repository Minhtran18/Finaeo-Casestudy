# ![Alt text](1.png) *A new Insurtech super star* 
## Overview and Origin: [1](https://www.finaeo.com/our-founding-story/)
* Finaeo Inc. [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/company/finaeo/)
* Founded in 2016
* [Aly Dhalla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alydhalla/?ppe=1) (Co-Founder, CEO) and [Donald Chu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donaldchu/) (Co-Founder, CCO)

With the background from the group benefits section and understand how onerous of paperwork and long insurance process is [1](https://www.finaeo.com/our-founding-story/). The co-founders built Finaeo **("Financial advisor hero")** in 2016 as a handful assistant to handle back-office tasks so that "Financial Advisor Hero" can spend more time to reach out and help more clients. In 2017, Finaeo launched its first beta of the program.

## Funding:
In September 2016, Finaeo got the initial seed round with 67.5K [2](https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organizations/last_funding_type/finaeo-inc), after it was oversubscribed at $2.25M in 2017 [3](https://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/09/prweb14655027.htm). The investment was led by Impression Ventures but included 500 Startups, Robo Ventures, and iGan Partners as other angel investors involved in the deal. In March 2019, Finaeo secured a $5.35M funding, led by Luge capital [4](https://www.prweb.com/releases/finaeo_secures_5_35_million_to_transform_the_distribution_of_insurance/prweb16188154.htm).

## Business Activities:
Finaeo's ambition is to become an Amazon of the Insurance industry, a fully integrated marketplace connects carriers, brokers, and clients with digital experience. At the first stage, Finaeo is focusing on 3 key advisor targets [5](https://jasonpereira.ca/all-content-jason-pereira-toronto/2018/finea):
1. Early advisors who are 0-2 years in the industry looking for infrastructure.
2. Growth stage advisors with 3-5 years in the industry making $75,000-$125,000 annually in income.
3. Advisors towards the end of their career that are looking to exit in 3-5 years.

Finaeo strongly believes that the client-advisor relationship does matter in the Insurance industry and should not be eliminated by disrupted technology like Robo-advisors. Finaeo points out that the missing piece here is a tool to leverage the advisors. They should have spent more time to reach more clients and help more people rather than being pulled back by paperwork or any repetitive tasks like auto-filling applications. Finaeo’s free CRM platform allows insurance advisors to sell personalized life insurance products efficiently by getting a quote on-demand in real-time. The virtual back-office connectivity to insurance carriers to do application submission and update real-time application status from their app or text message, which will finally enable a customer-centric approach to interacting with the insurance industry. Financial advisors also get help from a Digital Assistant to organize and track daily tasks, such as scheduling meetings, follow-up emails in a timeframe, and prioritize tasks as well as tracking monthly sales goals.

Finaeo also built a series of tools for carriers like E-application to improve and transform legacy systems into API form-factor. Ultimately, Finaeo runs analytic for carriers so they can compare their products with the benchmark and recreate or improve their products.
## Technology: [6](https://www.insurance-canada.ca/insurtech-spotlight/finaeo/)
 Finaeo builds an in-house CRM system using “serverless” cloud infrastructure, powered by Amazon AWS Lamda [11](https://www.finaeo.com/security/). For architecture and automated workflows across both web and mobile (iOS and Android application) to allow the advisors and clients to have access wherever they go and whenever they want, Finaeo uses deep machine learning data. This technology helps Finaeo becomes one of the first comers in the Insurtech segment to streamline, automate the entire insurance process, making it more efficient, more transparent, and especially more joyful on an insurance buying journey like the shopping experience on Amazon.

## Landscape:
The insurance industry has been around for over a hundred years and their platforms are legacy. The industry now is seen as the next big opportunity after Fintech. As per Mordor Intelligence website [7](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-insurtech-market), Global Insurtech Market revenue is valued at 5.48 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach 10.14 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 10.80% during the period 2019-2025. Aly mentioned that the Insurance industry is so huge but also legacy that almost all of the carriers were disconnected from the distribution of customers so Finaeo is like a fighter to build a bridge that connects it directly to the insurer and waking up those giants insurance companies. 

Aly stated that Finaeo doesn't have a pure competitor either in Canada or globally as Finaeo is the first business model of its kind. He sees other startups or Insurtech companies working in different aspects [5](https://jasonpereira.ca/all-content-jason-pereira-toronto/2018/finea). Also in the podcast, he mentioned that he would be willing to cooperate and join a project with 3rd parties to build an ecosystem for Insurtech and Finaeo.

## Recommendations:
As per Capterra reviewers [8](https://www.capterra.com/p/155561/Finaeo/), people like Finaeo's business and interface. The most cons comment is that the app still has issues like bugs and erros. My recommendation is to focus more on improving the app's performance to provide a smooth and flawless app experience before continuing with new projects. 

The new product that I would recommend Finaeo to build and develop in the future is the AI language assistant. Canada is known as an immigrant country meaning that there are many languages that are being used in this country. In all, 20.0% of Canada's population reported speaking a language other than English or French at home [9](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/as-sa/98-314-x/98-314-x2011001-eng.cfm). Clients will tend to look for an Insurance advisor within their cultural background and be able to communicate in their first language. 

A meeting note summary, a record of the conversation between client and advisor, or client's need analysis form in the client's preferred language will be auto-translated in English/French from the Finaeo mobile app or website. After that, the advisor will review the translation version and send it to the back-office for a regular process like analyzing, getting a quote, or connecting with MGA (Managing General Agent) to get the policy.
This product function will attract more advisors coming to Finaeo or even encourage future advisors who are not confident in English but have an Insurance background or want to enter to the Insurance industry. 
It also will speed up the time from client initial meeting to close the deal as the translating process is done instantly right after their conversation with clients.

What technology used in here [10](https://www.zelenka-translations.com/blog/modern-technologies-in-translation
):
1. CAT tools (computer-assisted translation)
2. Machine Translation (MT)
3. CMS – Content Management System
4. TMS – Translation Management System (information systems and translation service portals).

We are in the Digital Age where people don't need to learn other languages to communicate anymore. This concept and technologies are already developed for travelers and businessmen and will become a norm in the future so this project idea will help Finaeo one step ahead of the global trend.
